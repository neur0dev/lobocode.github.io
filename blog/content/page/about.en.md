### Hello, welcome to my blog.

I'm a Software Engineer, writer, gamer and independent researcher. I have been working professionally with technology for about 10 years. Outside of work I like literature, art, cinema, music, comics, manga, anime, a good beach, riding a bike and enjoying my free time with my partner and taking care of our cats. I am also involved in free/open source software initiatives such as **[Taverna dos Javeiros](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PL18Eo0t4Gk5XRjRBG3YY8Hqm4tk1vVDMP)**,**[Marmota Project](https://marmotaproject.github.io)**, **[Project Atomic](https://github.com/projectatomic)**, **[Fedora Project](https://getfedora.org/pt_BR/)**.
