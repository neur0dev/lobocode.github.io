Hello, my name is Vitor Lobo, too know as (neurodev) in the community. I'm autistic, Software Engineer, writer, gamer and independent researcher. I've been working with technology for over 10 years and I'm passionate about art and culture, such as literature, cinema, music, comics, manga, anime and even a good beach! I love riding my bike and enjoying my free time with my partner and our cats. In addition, I'm also an open source enthusiast and I'm involved in some projects, such as:

* **[Kubernetes-client](https://github.com/kubernetes-client/java)** - Kubernetes client for java.
* **[Marmota Project](https://marmotaproject.github.io)** - A project from who needs to learn Golang.
* **[Fedora Project](https://getfedora.org/pt_BR/)** - A community Linux Distribution.

Being autistic is part of who I am, and I'm proud of it. However, I know that for many autistic people, talking about the diagnosis can be a challenge. We autistics often face difficulties expressing ourselves and communicating with others. We are often misunderstood or judged for our differences. In addition, the stigma and prejudice surrounding autism can lead to fear and anxiety about revealing our condition to other people.

Sharing my experience as an autistic person is a way of showing that we all have our peculiarities and challenges, but that does not prevent us from living our lives and following our passions. I believe that by addressing the issue and sharing our stories, we can help combat stigma, create empathy and build a more inclusive and understanding world for all.
